# pwnagotchi-mail
An easier-to-use alternative to pwnagotchi's built-in mail commands

## Installation
To install, simply copy the `mail` executable to a binary folder, or run the following one-liner.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astro-cyberpaws/pwnagotchi-mail && sudo cp ./pwnagotchi-mail/mail /bin/mail && sudo chmod +x /bin/mail && rm -rf ./pwnagotchi-mail
```

## Usage
Working on it, just use `mail -h` for now, it's pretty self-explanatory
